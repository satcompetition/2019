<h2>Just a single track</h2>

<p>
SAT Race 2019 will have only one track which is comparable to the Main Track of a SAT Competition.
The track will focus on sequential SAT solvers. We will use 300-600 benchmark problems, the time limit will be 5000 seconds.
All solvers participating are required to provide certificates in both SAT and UNSAT cases. For more information about the
UNSAT certificates see <a href="index.php?cat=certificates">this page</a>.<br/>
</p>

<h2>Execution Environment</h2>
<p>The race will be run on the <a href="https://www.starexec.org/starexec/public/about.jsp">StarExec cluster</a>.
The time limit for solving an instance will be 5000 seconds (in each track). The solvers will be allowed to use up to 128GB of RAM.</p>

<!-- The Incremental Library Track will be run on computers with 2 x Intel Xeon X5355 2.66 GHz (4-Core) processors and 24GB of RAM.
