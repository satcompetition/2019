    <h1>SAT Race 2019</h1>
    
<h3>
Affiliated with the 
  <a href="http://sat2019.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/">The 22nd International Conference on Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing</a><br/>
taking place July 7 - 12, Lisboa, Portugal.
</h3>

<p>
The 2019 SAT Race is a competitive event for solvers of the Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problem.
It is organized as a satellite event to the 
<a href="http://sat2019.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/">22nd International Conference on Theory
and Applications of Satisfiability Testing</a>
and stands in the tradition of the yearly <a href="http://www.satcompetition.org">SAT Competitions</a> and <a href="related.html">SAT-Races / Challenges</a>.
</p>


<h3>SAT Race</h3>
<p>
The SAT Race 2019 is a lean competitive event that evaluates the
state-of-the-art SAT solvers. Compared to SAT Competitions, a SAT Race
has only one track which is comparable to the Main Track of a SAT
Competition.
</p>

<h3>New benchmarks welcome</h3>
<p>
Each participant (team) is encouraged to submit 20 new benchmark instances (not seen in previous competitions).
Ideally, the benchmarks should be "interesting": not too easy (solvable by MiniSat in a minute) or too hard (unsolvable by the participants own solver within one hour on
a computer similar to the <a href="https://www.starexec.org/starexec/public/machine-specs.txt">nodes of the StarExec cluster</a>).
See <a href="benchmarks.html">the benchmarks page</a> for more information.

</ul>
</p>


<h3><a name="Objective">Objective</a></h3>
<p>
The area of SAT Solving has seen tremendous progress over the last years.
Many problems (e.g. in hardware and software verification) that seemed to be completely out of reach a decade ago can now be handled routinely.
Besides new algorithms and better heuristics, refined implementation techniques turned out to be vital for this success.
</p>
<p>
To keep up the driving force in improving SAT solvers, we want to motivate implementors to present their work to a broader audience and to compare it with that of others.
